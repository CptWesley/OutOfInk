# OutOfInk
Tool to manipulate the CMY colour values of PDFs if you want to print but one of your colours ran out. You can access the tool [here](https://cptwesley.github.io/OutOfInk/).
The tool functions purely client-side, meaning that no PDFs are actually send to any server and all the magic happens within your own browser!
